Dialogue: 0,0:17:31.17,0:17:33.90,Default,Maomao,0,0,0,,So, that could be why she failed at her dance,
Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.17,0:17:37.91,Default,Maomao,0,0,0,,to avoid attracting the attention of the emperor.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:38.64,0:17:43.13,Default,Maomao,0,0,0,,And as intended, the emperor never touched her. Her body is still pure.
