ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,930
JADE PAVILION: MAOMAO

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,140
What should we do…?

4
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,350
What do you think, sir?

5
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,640
THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

6
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,890
MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

7
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,100
After the execution

8
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,440
of Fengming, her relatives were robbed of their wealth,

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,820
and were sentenced to varying degrees of corporal punishment.

10
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,910
The crime was said to be committed by Fengming alone,

11
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,370
and it was fortunate that her master, Ah-Duo, was not questioned.

12
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,500
And now,

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,290
I have the names from Fengming's family and anyone with connections to the family.

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,880
The list contains names of the customers who conducted business with the family.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,720
They did a wide variety of business, not just beekeeping.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,930
There are about 80 people with connections

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,550
in the rear palace.

18
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,180
Eighty people out of 2,000, huh?

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,980
That's quite a blow.

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,730
JADE PAVILION: MAOMAO

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,400
The party where the Apothecary was sold off to after being kidnapped

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,730
had connections to the family.

23
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,530
We can cover this up if you'd like.

24
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,820
"If you'd like."

25
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,950
Of course, what else?

26
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,330
It doesn't matter if it's right or wrong.

27
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,540
Whatever I say will happen.

28
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,170
She's clear about the divide between commoners and nobility.

29
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,340
She'll follow whatever order is given to her.

30
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,590
It's simple for me to strike down any order.

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,640
I can just decide right now.

32
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,230
If I cover this up, I can keep her in the rear palace.

33
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,650
But what if that's not what she wants?

34
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,570
If she learned she was forced to remain where she didn't want to be,

35
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,570
how would she react?

36
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,410
I'm afraid of deepening the gap

37
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:24,410
that already exists between us.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
Sir Jinshi.

39
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,170
I thought she was just a convenient chess piece.

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,220
-A mass firing? -Yeah, that's right.

41
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,050
All the daughters of parents that did business

42
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,560
with that family have to quit.

43
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,980
It's going to be a large number of girls.

44
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,390
I see…

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,650
There's a lot of girls who are panicking because they have to quit suddenly.

46
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,320
Looks like that family did business with a lot of people.

47
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,610
I have a bad feeling about this.

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,160
I'd be in a bind if I was fired right now.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,490
The timing is bad.

50
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,540
After Lihaku's visit,

51
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,870
I haven't been able to send any wealthy customers to Grams.

52
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
If I go back now…

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,920
I'm home!

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,500
Here's a customer!

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,510
I'll definitely be sold off…

56
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,800
Maomao?

57
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,440
When I checked last time, my registered family was

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,560
listed as a merchant family that conducts trade.

59
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,910
If Fengming's family are bee farmers,

60
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,040
they may have some kind of

61
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,620
connection!

62
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,290
Sir Jinshi!

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,180
What's wrong? You're out of breath.

64
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,220
-Well… -Calm down. Your face is all red.

65
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,730
I need to talk to you.

66
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,480
Fine. Let's talk inside.

67
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,740
It's about the mass firing, right?

68
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,990
Yes.

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,030
-What'll happen to me? -Here's the registry.

70
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,450
THE JADE PAVILION: MAOMAO

71
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,950
So I'll be fired?

72
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,670
What do you want?

73
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,170
I thought she was just a convenient chess piece.

74
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,470
Ever since I became Lady Gyokuyou's attendant,

75
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,890
I can taste test, and have access to the medical office.

76
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,770
I enjoy the life I have now.

77
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,980
But I'm just a palace woman.

78
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,280
I'm in no position to request not to be fired.

79
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,030
I can't look like I'm begging…

80
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,450
I'm just a palace woman.

81
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,540
Whether it's menial work, cooking, or taste testing,

82
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,460
I'll do whatever you say, if it's an order.

83
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,840
"If it's an order…"

84
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,550
That's right.

85
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,760
As long as it's an order, I can get through this.

86
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,840
I won't complain even if my salary goes down.

87
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,600
If I can buy some time before I'm sold off, I can survive.

88
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,390
So, don't fire me!

89
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,480
I understand.

90
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,900
So…

91
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,400
I'll pay as much as I can.

92
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,570
-Oh… -Negotiation failed.

93
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
Maomao has been fired.

94
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,410
All right, then.

95
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,420
How long are you going to stay like that?

96
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,720
You should have stopped her.

97
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Don't say anything.

98
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,270
The week after she was dismissed,

99
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,770
Xiaomao returned to the pleasure district.

100
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,230
I hear she was courteous

101
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,530
and said goodbye to all the people that took care of her.

102
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,320
I won't help you even if you regret this.

103
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,120
He lost his favorite toy.

104
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,830
It'll be a lot of work to find an interesting replacement toy for him.

105
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,830
I want the other one!

106
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,380
No…

107
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,090
Perhaps that girl isn't a toy after all.

108
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,720
He didn't make her stay because he didn't want to use her.

109
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,520
What a burdensome master I have. He's a lot of work.

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,230
If I can't find a replacement…

111
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,730
Perhaps I'll ask that soldier.

112
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,980
Depressed, sulking, gloomy…

113
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,490
See. You look better without freckles!

114
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll lend you my lipstick.

115
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,210
I never imagined that I would ever get ready for a banquet with Maomao…

116
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,250
Our work tonight is

117
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,380
a banquet for the nobility held outside of the brothel.

118
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,800
It costs that much money to invite courtesans to one's mansion.

119
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,720
Not only that,

120
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,220
one night of entertainment costs a year's worth of salary for a common man.

121
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,720
To call the Three Princesses of the Verdigris House at the same time…

122
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,230
Some people are just really rich, huh?

123
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,610
I might be going with you,

124
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,530
but I'll just be there to support you, Big Sisters.

125
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,860
Here you go, Maomao.

126
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,450
I was able to get more money than I imagined when I left the rear palace.

127
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,870
That's why I was able to prevent being sold off.

128
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,160
A supporting role is very important.

129
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,120
Let's work hard, Maomao!

130
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,880
You're really cute!

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,340
It's almost time! Hurry up…

132
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,220
Hey, you look better than usual.

133
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,800
I can get you a customer right now, if you'd like.

134
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,940
Looks like Grams really wants me to be a courtesan.

135
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,650
Go earn us some money!

136
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,440
I can't sing poetry, and I can't play erhu.

137
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,650
Never mind dancing.

138
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm just an apothecary's daughter who's only interested in medicine.

139
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,160
But she keeps approaching me with offers these past few years…

140
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,430
As expected of nobility.

141
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,150
This house is packed with super-expensive furnishings!

142
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm sure they won't notice if I take one…

143
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,030
No, I shouldn't.

144
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,530
It's this room right here.

145
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,290
I hear they're high court officials who are friends of Lihaku's.

146
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,330
But they're younger than I imagined.

147
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,880
Drool…

148
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,880
All right, let's go.

149
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,430
If he knew someone this rich,

150
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,430
he should've introduced me earlier!

151
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,100
If they're Lihaku's connections,

152
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,480
then some of my debt might've been taken away.

153
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,690
All right, I have to work.

154
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,920
I know it's work, but it's tiring to smile all the time.

155
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,670
Oh? Isn't he entertained?

156
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,010
Excuse me.

157
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,800
Leave me alone.

158
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,760
I want to be alone.

159
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,510
Huh? His voice sounds familiar…

160
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,190
Sir Jinshi?

161
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,820
Why are you running away?

162
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,030
You can't touch courtesans. Don't you know?

163
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,910
Has anyone ever told you that you look really different with makeup?

164
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,660
I get that a lot.

165
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,910
Why are you dressed like that?

166
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,700
I'm earning money.

167
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,830
-At a brothel? -Yes.

168
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,750
Could it be, you…?

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,500
He must be in the habit of questioning people's chastity.

170
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,340
I don't take any personal customers.

171
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,090
-Yet. -Yet…

172
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,310
Shall I buy you, then?

173
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,970
What? You've got to be kidding…

174
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,270
Wait, that might be a good idea.

175
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,570
It won't be so bad to work in the rear palace again.

176
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,820
I thought you quit because you didn't like it there.

177
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,070
What? When did I say that?

178
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,580
I said I wanted to keep working there. You're the one that fired me.

179
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,870
What?

180
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,330
Yes, it was annoying work,

181
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,880
but not anyone can become a food taster.

182
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,340
My only complaint was I couldn't experiment with my poisons.

183
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,720
You shouldn't experiment with poison.

184
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,140
His expressions are really childish today…

185
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,730
That's right. That's the kind of person you are.

186
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,730
What do you mean?

187
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,730
Are you ever told that you don't explain yourself enough?

188
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,940
I get that a lot.

189
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,240
Why are you running from me?

190
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,570
It's the rules.

191
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,910
-It's just a little. -It's against the rules.

192
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,620
-It won't cost you anything! -My willpower.

193
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,580
Just one hand. Just the fingertips!

194
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,580
I forgot how stubborn this guy was…

195
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,380
Just the fingertips, okay?

196
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,260
What…

197
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,270
This dude…

198
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,350
Now I'm blushing too!

199
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,940
Oh, when did that happen?

200
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,820
-You should've told us, Maomao! -So embarrassing.

201
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,990
Hey, Big Sisters! Sir Gaoshun?

202
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,870
I was in so much of a frenzy

203
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't really remember what happened after.

204
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,080
-Who was that? -How do you know him?

205
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,830
Geez. You're good!

206
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,960
I just remember that Big Sisters' interrogations were

207
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,840
never-ending…

208
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,090
VERDIGRIS HOUSE

209
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,600
All right, next…

210
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,930
I'll make some just in case.

211
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,600
Nothing good ever happens without my freckles.

212
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,850
That must've been last winter…

213
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,150
I was surprised to be kidnapped,

214
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,740
but to think I was sold off to the rear palace…

215
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,700
Not only that, I also got promoted to be an attendant.

216
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,920
I was supposed to stay out of people's business until my term was up…

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,380
Maomao. Is it ready?

218
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,960
Yeah. Here it is.

219
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,430
I need you to see a patient. Can you do it?

220
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
Okay.

221
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,730
The rear palace, huh?

222
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,700
That's the one place I never wanted to get involved in…

223
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,450
I hope everyone's doing well.

224
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm leaving now.

225
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,710
Stay put. You only have so many chances to bathe here.

226
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,100
So what are your plans now?

227
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,060
I'll pay back my debt.

228
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,850
Of course you will.

229
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,360
Are you going back to the rear palace?

230
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,280
I don't know.

231
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,740
But maybe, the rear palace and the pleasure district…

232
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,700
Are not so different.

233
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
I see.

234
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,960
Can't sleep?

235
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm going to get some fresh air.

236
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,390
-Be careful. -Yeah.

237
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,800
The rear palace, the pleasure district, it's all the same…

238
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
It's a flower garden, and a bird's cage…

239
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,250
LUOMEN

240
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,720
What will happen next?

241
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,890
So cold…

242
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,650
VERDIGRIS HOUSE

243
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,480
A few days later,

244
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,400
a beautiful nobleman comes to the capital's pleasure district.

245
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,450
Equipped with enough money to make even Grams happy,

246
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,200
and, for some reason…

247
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,090
a strange plant growing out of an insect…

248
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,430
All this man wished for was one girl.

249
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,520
